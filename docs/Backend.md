### Spring Boot
The spring boot framework provides lots of out of box features and tools for creating web applications, handling data persistence and creating restful apis

##### Entity
Traditionally creating and loading data onto table in a database would be a tedious process. First, you would initalize a table, then define the table layout(columns) and then fill each column with data. Using entities simplifies this process and makes interacting with tables less of a headache. 

Each row can be represented as an object where each column is an attribute/field instead of defining the schema of a table. However, how can a collection of objects on a heap represent a table on a database? This is possible through object-relational mapping 

At an abstract level, Entity classes represent a table, and each instance of an entity class would represent a row on a table.
